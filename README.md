Hello! My name is Ivan Zimmerman and I'm a high school senior applying to CS undergraduate programs for the Fall 2026 semester. I'm interested in programming languages and operating systems, and I usually program in Rust or Python. Most of the projects I've made are local, but I've uploaded some here as well.
